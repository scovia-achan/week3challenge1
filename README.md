#sorting a list

The list_sort.py sorts a list in terms of odd numbers, even numbers and characters. It creates a dictionary with keys of 'odd', 'even' and 'char' and prints the values respectively.

#finding missing

The function missing_numbers() takes a sequence of numbers in a list and returns missing numbers (if any) in that list
